        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My hobbies include, sound design and music production. Based on the 5 past years, I would have to say “Watch Men” was my favorite tv show. And finally, did you know that John Chowing developed FM synthesis (Frequency Modulation) in the 1960’s?
            The algorithm was later licensed to a famous Japanese company called Yamaha in 1973, which would later shape the sound of 80’s music and beyond. </p>
